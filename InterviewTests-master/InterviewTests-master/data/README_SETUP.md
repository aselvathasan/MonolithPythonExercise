Make you have conda installed prior to beginning. 

In order to begin set up please open a bash terminal or conda terminal.

Change directory to the folder containing this file.

python -m ipykernel install --user --name monolith_env --display-name "Python (monolith_env)"  

jupyter lab

In order to view my prototyping methodology for this assignment please see "Quality_Assurance_Classifier_Prototyping.ipynb".
