# InterviewTest

## Instructions:

Welcome to the Monolith AI interview test. As you know, Monolith applies data-science and machine learning to accelerate engineering design. In the next 3 hours you will have your own chance to do exactly that... 

Engineering Corp (EC) manufactuers widgets and during the manufacturing process they monitor 591 different sensors to try and track the quality of their production. Unfortunately, EC still has an unacceptably high failure rate. Your mission should you choose to accept it is to build a classifier that can identify which widgets are likely to fail based on the sensor data and also to identify which of the 591 sensors is most useful for doing this.

In the data folder of this respository you will find the sensor data alongside a description of what the data contains. Once you have built your classifer then please prepare a short presentation explaining what you have done. Some things that Engineering Corp cares about are::

1) How good is your final classifier? 
2) Why did you choose the method you did?
3) What is the uncertainty in your predictions?
4) Which sensor readings are the most useful? How do you know?
5) How did you pre-process the data?

Below are the instructions for the exercise. If you get stuck on stages 1 or 2, please ask for help.

### Steps:

1) Fork this github repository and create your own branch with your name as the branch name.

2) (If onsite) You should have been provided with a virtual environment with your name, otherwise please create one. Use pip/conda to install any packages you think you will need to complete the task and push a requirements file with all the dependencies you use to the repo.

3) Perform any data-exploration and analysis you like and upload any code you use to your branch in the repository. It is reccomended that you document your thought process in a seperate file as you work and push this to your repository when you are finished. When you are done please share your the link to your forked repository with us.

4) Prepare a short presentation on what you did to present to the data-science team.
